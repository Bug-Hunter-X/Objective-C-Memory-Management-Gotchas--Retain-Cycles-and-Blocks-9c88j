In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves improper handling of object ownership and memory management, particularly when dealing with delegates and blocks.  Consider this scenario: 

```objectivec
@interface MyDelegate : NSObject <MyProtocol> 
@end

@implementation MyDelegate
- (void)someMethod:(id)sender {
    // ... some code ...
}
@end

@interface MyClass : NSObject <MyProtocol> {
  MyDelegate *delegate;
}
@property (nonatomic, weak) MyDelegate *delegate;

@implementation MyClass

- (void)someMethod {
  // ... some code ...
  self.delegate = [[MyDelegate alloc] init]; // Creating a new delegate object
  [self.delegate someMethod:self];
}
@end
```

The problem:  If `MyClass` doesn't retain the `delegate` object (using `strong` instead of `weak`), a retain cycle is created. When `MyClass` is deallocated, the delegate still exists, preventing proper memory management. This could lead to crashes or memory leaks, especially if the delegate holds a strong reference back to `MyClass`.

Another potential issue is using blocks without proper handling of object lifecycles. Consider this example:
```objectivec
- (void)doSomethingWithCompletion:(void (^)(BOOL success))completion {
  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
    // ... some long running task ...
    if (completion) completion(YES);
  });
}
```
If the object that calls `doSomethingWithCompletion` is deallocated before the block completes, the `completion` block might attempt to access deallocated memory, leading to a crash.
